# CAC Demo

## Run It

```
docker-compose up
```

gets it started.

```
docker-compose exec web service nginx start
```

starts NGINX; the RUN command for it inside the Dockerfile is not doing the trick. This should be fixed.

Make sure you have the sample PromptWorks PIVKey and a smart-card reader. Navigate to `http://localhost`. This should display a basic index page with a link to login via CAC card. Click the link, and you should then be prompted to choose a certificate to login. Both the ART GARFUNKEL example certificate and the manufacturer's certificate should work for authentication (both are in the certificate authority bundle). The app should display a welcome message with some basic info about the cert.
