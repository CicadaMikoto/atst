      performance_period_description: Choose the length of time your task order covers.
      performance_period_paragraph: Consider starting with a shorter period of performance (PoP)—three to six months. After your task order is approved and funds are obligated, that money is committed to the cloud service provider—meaning that even if you don’t wind up needing all of the money you requested in your task order, you won’t be able to retrieve unspent funds. Submitting smaller, more manageable task orders (with smaller, more manageable budgets) allows you to avoid over-obligating funds. You’ll be notified when your period of performance is nearing its end, in time to request your next set of funds through a new task order.
      performance_period_title: Period of performance
