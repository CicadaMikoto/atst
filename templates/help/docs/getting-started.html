<h3>How to prepare for Financial Verification step?</h3>
<p>Once your request is approved, the next step is to create a Task Order (T.O.) associated with the JEDI Cloud ID/IQ.  Please contact a Contracting Officer (KO) or Contracting Officer Representative (COR) to help with this step. </p>
<p>This may also involve talking to your Financial Manager (FM) to secure funding.</p>
<p>Once the Task Order (T.O.) has been created, you will need to provide information related to the task order and funding in AT-AT. This step is referred to as “Financial Verification.”</p>
<p><em>We also recommend getting familiar with the <a href="#">JEDI Cloud CLIN structures</a> so that you know which specific services are available under JEDI and categorized for contracting purposes. This will help you and the Contracting Officer create a Task Order.</em></p>

<h3>Why is this important?</h3>
<p>This step allows AT-AT and the CCPO to track and report on cloud infrastructure spending across the Department., It also enables you and your team to see your cloud usage and verify your invoices with your budget.</p>

<h3>What to prepare for Financial Verification?</h3>
<p>You will need to have these details on hand before filling out the next step.</p>

<h2 id='jedi-cloud-applications'>JEDI Cloud Applications</h2>

<h3>How are applications organized in the JEDI Cloud?</h3>

<h4>Application Structure for JEDI Cloud</h4>

<p>Separate your portfolio into applications and environments; this allows your team to manage user access to systems more securely and track expenditures for each application.</p>
<p>Here’s an example:<br>
Application A has a development environment, production environment, and sandbox environment. The cloud resources in the development environment are grouped and accessed separately from the production environment and sandbox environment.</p>
